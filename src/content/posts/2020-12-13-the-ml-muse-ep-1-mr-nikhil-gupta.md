Hello! If this is the first time you're hearing about us, do check out the [About Us](https://aimlc-iitd.netlify.app/about) page. Welcome to the first episode of *The ML Muse Podcast*, where we speak to people who are innovating, creating in and stretching the boundaries of the fields of AI and ML. We bring you their journeys entering and working in this area and hope that you learn as much from listening to them as we do.

For our very first episode (<i class="fas fa-drum"></i>), Mr [Nikhil Gupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikhilgupta1997/) has been gracious enough to speak with us. Nikhil, who is a 2019 CSE graduate from IIT Delhi, is active in the IITD community, and personally, is someone we all admire. For those of you who are not familiar, I will attempt to explain why we're so excited to have him on. Nikhil is the co-founder of a startup called [LimeChat](https://limechat.ai/). A leader in AI Conversational Commerce, they're building India's first level 3 chatbot technology. He also had an illustrious student life at IITD, interning at Tower Research Capital, CMU and EPFL, among various other activities. His diverse background and achievements, with a deep passion for learning and helping people out (we can attest), make him the perfect guest. Without further ado, I present to you, Mr Nikhil Gupta in conversation with [Ramneet Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramneetsinghiitd/).
