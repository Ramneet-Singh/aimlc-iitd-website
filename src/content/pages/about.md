AIMLC aims to be the gathering place for students enthusiastic about learning, discussing and applying AI/ML to all kinds of problem-solving, be it academic or real-life.

We organize multiple fun and educational events in IITD related to AI/ML, like podcasts, expert talks, workshops, hackathons and more. We strive to lower the entry-barrier in the emerging field of AI/ML by providing opportunities to interact with leaders in industry and academia, and also a hands-on learning experience.

### Why did we start this club?

In recent times, the field of AI/ML has seen massive growth with large numbers of researchers and engineers entering academia and industry alike. With better and cheaper computational power, and a colossal amount of data generated every day, AI and ML are finding broader and deeper applications in every area. However, in IIT Delhi, we lacked a dedicated club to cater to the large community of students interested in this field. AIMLC strives to address this void by being the one-stop destination for IITD students passionate about AI/ML.
